# weather-forecast-app
As part of The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course, we were asked to build our own weather forecast web app. This project tests our ability to handle JavaScript Asynchronous Code, specifically, Promises and Async/Await. It also tests our ability to work with APIs. For this project I'm using OpenWeather's Public (Free) API.
